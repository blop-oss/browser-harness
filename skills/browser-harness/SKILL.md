description: Controls a persistent Playwright browser through the blop-browser CLI for UI verification, interaction, extraction, and screenshots. Use when a task requires a real browser, rendered page state, authenticated interaction, or deterministic web-app evidence.
license: MIT
compatibility: Requires the blop-browser executable and a local Chrome, Chromium, Playwright, Chrome CDP endpoint, or optional Camoufox browser. Camoufox requires Node.js 20 or newer.

# Browser harness

Use `blop-browser` through the shell. The CLI starts a local daemon on the
first tool call and keeps the same browser, tabs, action trail, and semantic
references across later invocations.

## Start here

Use the concise commands for the common path:

```bash
blop-browser open https://example.com
blop-browser snapshot
blop-browser click e1
blop-browser expect-text "Example Domain"
```

Inspect every available tool and retrieve its exact JSON input schema when
the concise commands do not cover the task:

```bash
blop-browser tools
blop-browser describe browser_click
```

Call tools with a JSON object:

```bash
blop-browser call browser_goto --input '{"url":"https://example.com"}'
blop-browser call browser_snapshot --input '{}'
blop-browser call browser_click --input '{"target":{"ref":"e1"}}'
```

Use `--json` when another program needs a stable machine-readable envelope.
Use `--session NAME` on every command when work must be isolated from the
default session.

## Agent-first setup

Agent shell calls are usually non-interactive, so don't expect the terminal
configuration wizard to appear. Before the first browser task, inspect the
saved configuration:

```bash
blop-browser doctor --json
```

If `configuration.mode` is `null`, ask the user through the agent's question UI
which mode they prefer. Persist the answer non-interactively before starting a
browser session:

```bash
blop-browser config --mode chromium-headless
blop-browser config --mode chromium-headed
blop-browser config --mode chrome-cdp --cdp-endpoint http://127.0.0.1:9222
blop-browser config --mode camoufox-headless
blop-browser config --mode camoufox-headed
```

Explain that Camoufox downloads a third-party browser before asking for that
choice. If asking isn't possible, continue with the safe default of headless
Chromium. Future agent sessions reuse the saved configuration automatically.

## Existing Chrome over CDP

When the user wants to reuse an existing Chrome profile, cookies, or open tabs,
connect through a localhost CDP endpoint:

```bash
google-chrome \
  --remote-debugging-address=127.0.0.1 \
  --remote-debugging-port=9222 \
  --user-data-dir=/tmp/blop-chrome \
  about:blank

blop-browser --session chrome --cdp-endpoint http://127.0.0.1:9222 snapshot
blop-browser --session chrome open https://example.com
```

A normal Chrome window is not automatically CDP-enabled. If `connectOverCDP`
reports a `404` for `/json/version`, the address is not a DevTools endpoint;
start Chrome on an unused localhost port or correct the endpoint instead of
retrying it. Use a dedicated `--user-data-dir` because Chrome may reject a
second process using an active profile.

The first command attaches to the most recently opened tab. Later commands
reuse the named connection without repeating the endpoint. If that tab is
closed outside the harness and a command reports that the target page or
context has closed, disconnect the stale session or choose a new session name,
then reconnect with `--cdp-endpoint` and take a fresh snapshot.

Treat the endpoint as privileged access to that profile. Don't expose it on a
public interface. `blop-browser --session chrome close` disconnects the harness
without closing Chrome.

## Browser choice

Run `blop-browser config` when the user wants to choose and save a default
browser mode interactively. The wizard also runs before the first interactive
browser command. In a non-interactive environment, pass one of the
documented modes explicitly, for example:

```bash
blop-browser config --mode chromium-headless
blop-browser config --mode chromium-headed
blop-browser config --mode chrome-cdp --cdp-endpoint http://127.0.0.1:9222
blop-browser config --mode camoufox-headless
```

Use Chromium by default. Camoufox is an optional third-party anti-detect
Firefox distribution for sites that reject automated Chromium traffic. A
Google page that blocks the default browser or presents repeated bot checks is
one reason to offer it; don't assume Camoufox is required for every Google
task.

Before installing or switching to Camoufox, tell the user that it downloads a
third-party browser and uses a different browser fingerprint. Ask the user if
they want to use it. Don't install or select it without their approval.

After the user approves, check availability and install it when needed:

```bash
blop-browser doctor --json
blop-browser install camoufox
```

Use a separate named session so an active Chromium session keeps its state:

```bash
blop-browser --session google --browser camoufox open https://www.google.com
blop-browser --session google --browser camoufox snapshot
```

Pass `--browser camoufox` on every command that can start the named session.
If the session already uses Chromium, close it deliberately or choose a new
session name. To return to the default browser, omit `--browser` or pass
`--browser chromium`.

## Browser workflow

1. Define the requested outcome and evidence before interacting.
2. Navigate with `browser_goto`.
3. Inspect the current page with `browser_snapshot`.
4. Prefer an opaque current `{ "ref": "e1" }` target. Copy refs exactly.
5. Handle visible dialogs or blockers before acting on occluded controls.
6. Take another snapshot after dismissing a dialog because its refs are stale.
7. For ads or timed media, wait only as needed, then act on a visible control;
   don't invent a skip action when the content may start automatically.
8. Use `browser_extract` for bounded data and `browser_expect_*` for proof.
9. Capture screenshots only when visual evidence adds value.
10. Call `finish_test` only after the requested result is proven.

Do not invent refs, bypass strict ambiguity, execute arbitrary page scripts,
or hide a failed tool call. Take a new snapshot after navigation or substantial
page changes.

## Session lifecycle

Check or stop a session explicitly:

```bash
blop-browser status
blop-browser close
```

The daemon also exits after its idle timeout. Run `blop-browser doctor` when
browser discovery or daemon startup fails. The doctor output reports Chromium
and Camoufox availability separately.
